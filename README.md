# MatrixProject

## Game Backstory

I made this game for the Robotics class of 2022 - 2023. The inspiration for this project was a game mode from Starcraft 2, a simple arcade game in which you had to dodge incoming missiles on a map, a pretty random source of inspiration, I admit. As you will see when playing, I have taken the "evading the missiles" part and incorporated it here as random traps on the matrix. I've also added a time and food mechanic. It gives players an incentive to move around the map by collecting the food to increase their remaining time. 

The process of building this game was pretty straightforward:

  1. I created a dot on the matrix for the player to move around
  2. I added a random food generation mechanic
  3. I added a score and time mechanic to go with the food collecting 
  4. I designed the traps and put them on the matrix
  5. I created 3 seperate difficulties **Easy**/**Normal**/**Hard** and added some new harder traps for the last one
